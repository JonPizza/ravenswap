# RavenSwap

RavenSwap sits on top of [Raven-Trader-Pro](https://github.com/ben-abraham/raven-trader-pro) and allows users to preform trades of Ravencoin to assets or assets to Ravencoin on the web. Currently, RavenSwap is no longer live due to the lack of use it recieved, but I've made it open source in the case that the Ravencoin ecosystem is resurrected. 

To run, have `ravend` running in the background and then call `app.py` using gunicorn or however you like to deploy Flask apps. 

Haaaave fun :)
